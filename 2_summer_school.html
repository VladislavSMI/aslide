                  To be honest, it is not the easiest language to learn but
                  during this summer course we try to combine fun & learning
                  together! Except learning language basics, practicing them
                  right on the spot, you'll get nice introduction to Chinese
                  culture and traditions!

                  Of course! Trips to the famous Great Wall of China or
                  Forbidden city, or to see traditional Chinese art performances
                  or tea ceremonies and much more are waiting for you. No
                  boundaries are set and you will definitely meet other
                  classmates wanting to explore more areas in China. There's
                  nothing easier than going with your new friends to explore
                  Beijing on your own or even make plans to travel to the
                  Terracotta Army, Avatar's Mountains, modern Shanghai, Suzhou
                  Floating Gardens and many other destinations after the school
                  finishes!

                  of the course! Small advice - learning to write chinese
                  characters goes easiest with a pencil! So if you have a
                  favorite one, don't forget to pack it with you!
