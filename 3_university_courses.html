                  Our current language center is located at the campus of the
                  University of Science and Technology in Beijing. One or two
                  semester course start at the beginning of September or March.
                  Each semester consists of 13 weeks (including some of national
                  holidays which you can use for relax, travelling or further
                  boosting your Chinese!), followed by week of exams, when you
                  can make your HSK language certificate. Classes are held in
                  small groups of students from all over the world, running
                  every week from Monday to Friday starting at 8 AM until noon,
                  sometimes classes can be held afternoon, too. You will have
                  free weekends, which will serve you as perfect opportunity to
                  hit the streets of Beijing, discover the beauty of China or
                  simply unwind from all the learning. There are also various
                  trips organized by the learning center to visit Great Wall,
                  museums or traditional Chinese art performances. Different
                  types of classes alternate throughout the language course:
                  口语 Speaking, 听力 Listening, 阅读 Reading and 语法 Grammar
                  where you will learn how to properly write Chinese characters.
                  Cultural classes, history as well as Taiqi or calligraphy will
                  also be part of the semester. Upon successful completion of
                  the course, the student will receive a certificate and the
                  possibility to participate in the HSK tests. After the course
                  you can obtain HSK 4/5 which corresponds to B2 level of the
                  European language framework.
